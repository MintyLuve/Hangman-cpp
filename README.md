# Hangman-cpp
Hangman made in C++ for a school assignment

### Split up:
Person 1: made functions that printed out a state of the hangman

Person 2: created the main function, how it called all of the functions, and made the 'want to play again?'

Person 3: created the calculating score, the function that takes the word, finds its letters, and sees if it was correct or incorrect- outputs true or false
